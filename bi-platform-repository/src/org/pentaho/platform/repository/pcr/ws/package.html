<p>
This package contains a <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a>-safe version of the IUnifiedRepository 
interface. JAX-WS cannot handle interfaces in method signatures or return values, method overloading, or static inner 
classes, and possibly other features of the Java language. In addition, JAXB, the default serialization technology of
JAX-WS, cannot automatically marshal and unmarshal all objects. To help it, XmlJavaTypeAdapters are employed.
</p>
<p>
Clients should never use the JAX-WS-safe version of the IUnifiedRepository interface. Instead, clients should code to 
the IUnifiedRepository interface and use the adapter layer to convert the calls into calls on the web service client. In
this way, the client code is location unaware--it can be calling code in the same JVM or a remote JVM.
